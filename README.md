# ‚úàÔ∏è Airlines Data Analysis Project Using SQL and Power BI
## üìå 1. Project Overview -
This project analyzes an airline dataset of **300,000+ flight records** to uncover business insights using **PostgreSQL** and visualize them with **Power BI**.  
The dataset includes flight details such as airline, route, stops, duration, ticket class, price, and booking lead time.


## üéØ 2. Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning and transformation** in SQL.
- Write **50+ SQL business queries** (basic to advanced).
- Build **analytical views** in PostgreSQL for optimized BI reporting.
- Apply **Window Functions** (LAG, LEAD, RANK, NTILE, etc.).
- Create **Views** for BI-ready datasets.
- Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for decision-making

## üßÆ SQL Analysis

## üìú 4. SQL Work Summary
* **Basic Queries**: Total flights, avg. price per airline, etc.
* **Intermediate Queries**: Price trends by booking days, duration vs. price.
* **Advanced Queries**: Rank routes, moving averages, seasonal demand.
* **Window Functions**: RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, LEAD, NTILE.
* **Views**: Pre-aggregated BI tables for fast reporting.
---

## üìä Power BI Dashboard
---
The dashboard contains **5 pages**:
1. **Executive Overview**
2.  **Airline Performance**
3.  **Route Analysis**
4.  **Pricing & Booking**
5.  **Class & Customer Segmentation**
---
1Ô∏è‚É£ Power Query ‚Äî Data Preparation Steps-
* Step 1: Import file.
* Load the CSV (300k+ rows) from your folder.
* Ensure column data types:
* duration ‚Üí Decimal Number
* days_left ‚Üí Whole Number
* price ‚Üí Whole Number
*  Date columns (if you have actual dates) ‚Üí Date
* Step 2: Clean Columns
* Remove duplicates (if any).
* Trim & clean text in columns.
* Step 3: Add Derived Columns in Power Query.
* Trip Type : Conencting, Direct
* Route : [source_city] & " ‚Üí " & [destination_city].
* Price Category : Low, Meedium, High.
---
2Ô∏è‚É£ DAX Measures
* Add Measures and Core KPIs.
---
3Ô∏è‚É£Insights
### Price & Category
* Low-cost flights (<‚ÇπX) = {PctLow}% of total.
* High-cost flights (>‚ÇπY) = {PctHigh}% of total.
* Avg price (Economy) = ‚Çπ{AvgEco}, (Business) = ‚Çπ{AvgBus}.
### Routes & Cities
* Top route: {Source} ‚Üí {Destination} ({CountFlights} flights).
* Highest avg fare city: {City} (‚Çπ{AvgFare}).
* Cheapest route: {Source} ‚Üí {Destination} (‚Çπ{Fare}).
### Time & Booking
* Booking >{Days} days early saves ‚Çπ{Savings}.
* Evening flights cost ‚Çπ{Diff} more/less than morning.
* Cheapest departure slot: {TimeSlot}.
### Stops & Duration
Direct flights cost {Diff%} more/less than with stops.
Longest flight: {Duration} hrs ({Route}).
Avg duration with {Stops} stops = {AvgDuration} hrs.
### Airline & Class
* Cheapest airline: {Airline} (‚Çπ{AvgFare}).
* Business class costs {Diff%} more than Economy.
* Widest class gap: {Route} (‚Çπ{Gap}).
